## Submit Code
There are no special requirements, just a few points:
- Use [Prettier](//prettier.io/) to format the code
- Try to leave comments
- Avoid writing into callback hell

## Improve Documentation
- Try to keep it simple
- Mark whether it is machine translation for non-Chinese
- Unless it is a modification for a specific language, modify it for each language
